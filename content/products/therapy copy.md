##### Facts about NPWT dressings

### What is the purpose of NPWT?

Therapy System promotes wound healing through Negative Pressure
Wound Therapy (NPWT). Delivering negative pressure (a vacuum) at
the wound site through a unique, proprietary dressing helps draw
wound edges together, removes infectious materials and actively
promotes formation of granulation tissue.

### How long do you keep NPWT dressing? 

It is usually recommended that you remain NPWT dressing for 48 to
72 hours, however your treating medical professional will advise on
the treatment plan for your wound.

### Is wound debridement painful?

After surgery to remove debris or dead tissue from your wound
(debridement), you can expect some pain and swelling around your
wound. This should get better within a few days after the procedure.


### Does a wound hurt more when healing?

Clear fluid coming from the wound, which helps to clean and
disinfect the damaged skin. New skin forming over the wound, and
the exposed wound start shrinking. This healing process creates little
pain. This process usually lasts two to three weeks, but deeper and
more severe wounds may require more healing time.

### How long do wounds take to heal?

After about five days into the wound healing process, the tissue re-
growth stage begins. It typically lasts around three weeks for minor
wounds, and it’s the time when the body repairs broken blood
vessels and replaces damaged tissues with healthy new ones.
